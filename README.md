This project presents a four-floor elevator control system model developed and implemented in the Automation Laboratory at Phenikaa University. The model is designed to simulate the core functionalities of a real-world elevator system, including:
- Floor selection and movement logic
- Door opening and closing operations
- Call buttons from each floor and inside the elevator
- Safety interlocks and emergency stop
- Floor indicator display and elevator status LEDs
Although implemented as a training model, the system fully replicates the behavior and logic of an actual elevator. The project uses PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) for real-time control and is intended for educational and research purposes in industrial automation.
